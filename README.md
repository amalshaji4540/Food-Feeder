A 3DOF robotic arm for feeding food to differently abled and aged people.
- Esp32 is used as the microcontroller.
- Servo motors are used at the joints of robot.
- Spoon is used as the end effector.
- An app is developed using MIT APP inventor for controlling the robotic arm. App communicated with esp32 via bluetooth transport.
